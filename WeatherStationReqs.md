weather stations are part of a larger system which is a weather information system that collects data from weather stations and makes it available to other systems for processing. 

1.The weather station system - This is responsible for collecting weather data, carrying out some initial data processing and transmitting it to the data management system.
2.The data management and archiving system - This system collects the data from all of the wilderness weather stations, carries out data processing and analysis and archives the data in a form that can be retrieved by other systems, such as weather forecasting systems.
3.The station maintenance system- This system can communicate by satellite with all wilderness weather stations to monitor the health of these systems and provide reports of problems. It can update the embedded software in these systems. In the event of system problems, this system can also be used to remotely control a wilderness weather system.


As they are deployed in wilderness areas, they are exposed to severe environmental conditions and may be damaged by animals. The station software is therefore not just concerned with data collection. It must also:

1.Monitor the instruments, power and communication hardware and report faults to the management system.
2.Manage the system power, ensuring that batteries are charged whenever the environmental conditions permit but also that generators are shut down in potentially damaging weather conditions, such as high wind.
3.Allow for dynamic reconfiguration where parts of the software are replaced with new versions and where backup instruments are switched into the system in the event of system failure.
